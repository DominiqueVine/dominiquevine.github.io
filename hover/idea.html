    <h2>The Three Texts</h2>

<h3>MAIN TEXT: The Crystal Goblet, or Printing Should Be Invisible</h3>

<p>
  <strong>Beatrice Warde (1930)</strong>
  <br>
  <br>
  In this reading Warde states that good typesetting should be functional and logical to convey the meaning and ideas of a text. She states that although using a fabulous and decorated font may look wonderful, it does not allow the reader to understand the text properly, instead a slick, modernist and functional layout allows the reader to see through the design and really understand the text properly.
<br>  <br>
  "...You have two goblets before you. One is of solid gold, wrought in the most exquisite patterns. The other is of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble, and as transparent. Pour and drink; and according to your choice of goblet, I shall know whether or not you are a connoisseur of wine...
  <br>  <br>
  ...almost all the virtues of the perfect wine-glass have a parallel in typography. There is the long, thin stem that obviates fingerprints on the bowl. Why? Because no cloud must come between your eyes and the fiery heart of the liquid. Are not the margins on book pages similarly meant to obviate the necessity of fingering the type-page?...
  <br>  <br>
  Now the man who first chose glass instead of clay or metal to hold his wine was a “modernist” in the sense in which I am going to use that term. That is, the first thing he asked of his particular object was not “How should it look?” but “What must it do?” and to that extent all good typography is modernist.
  <br>  <br>
  ...that the most important thing about printing is that it conveys thought, ideas, images, from one mind to other minds. This statement is what you might call the front door of the science of typography. Within lie hundreds of rooms; but unless you start by assuming that printing is meant to convey specific and coherent ideas, it is very easy to find yourself in the wrong house altogether.
  <br>  <br>
  ...Type well used is invisible as type, just as the perfect talking voice is the unnoticed vehicle for the transmission of words, ideas."
  <br>  <br>

  <strong>QUESTION</strong>
  <br>
Do you agree that good typography should be invisible, and if not, in what setting shold typography be loud and obvious?

  <h3>RELATED TEXT 1: The Elements of Typographic Style </h3>
  <p>
  <strong>The Grand Design—Robert Bringhurst (1992)</strong>
  <br>  <br>
  In this reading Bringhurst talks about how typography is so important, as it must draw attention towards itself before it is read. Type may "dance in the margins" and bring an energy to the text. He also states that typography layouts may have chapter heads and subheadings that require an individual style.
  <br>  <br>
  "...typography must often draw attention to itself before it will be read. Yet in order to be read, it must relinquish the attention it has drawn. Typography with anything to say therefore aspires to a kind of statuesque transparency.
  <br>  <br>
  ...One of the principles of durable typography is always legibility; another is something more than legibility; some earned or unearned interest that gives its living energy to the page. It takes various forms and goes by various names, including serenity, liveliness, laughter, grace and joy.
  <br>  <br>
  ...In a well-made book, where designer, compositor and printer have all done their jobs, no matter how many thousand of lines and pages, the letters are alive. They dance in their seats. Sometimes they rise and dance in the margins and aisles.
  <br>  <br>
  ...The typographer’s one essential task is to interpret and communicate the text. Its tone, its tempo, its logical structure, its physical size, all determine the possibilities of its typographic form. The typographer is to the text as the theatrical director to the script, or the musician to the score.
  <br>  <br>
  ...They are often layered with chapter heads, section heads, subheads, block quotations, footnotes, endnotes, lists and illustrative examples. Such features may be obscure in the manuscript, even if they are clear in the author’s mind. For the sake of the reader, each requires its own typographic identity and form. Every layer and level of the text must be consistent, distinct, yet harmonious in form.
  <br>  <br>
  ...Typography is the art and craft of handling these doubly meaningful bits of information. A good typographer handles them in intelligent, coherent, sensitive ways. When the type is poorly chosen, what the words say linguistically and what the letters imply visually are disharmonious, dishonest, out of tune.""

  <br>  <br>
  <strong>QUESTION</strong>
  <br>
  In this reading Bringhust mentions ways to attract a reader to a text through colour and use of text in margins, how else can you draw a reader to a text typographically?

  <h3>RELATED TEXT 2: The Shape of Words </h3>
  <p>
  <strong>Bruno Munari (1966)</strong>
  <br>  <br>
  In this reading, Munari states that "letters have individual shapes that create unique words". Moreover, Munari states that the layout of a text affects the way one reads something, and to stress the importance of certain words through spacing and colouring .
  <br>  <br>
  "...Not only does each letter of a word have a shape of its own, but all its letters taken together give shape to the word. We are of course referring to printed, or at least written, words; for the words we hear in speech or on the radio do not have a visual form.
  <br>  <br>
  ...Knowledge of the shape of words and the possibilities these offer for communication can be very useful to the graphic designer when he comes to make warning signs that have to be taken in quickly, like the ones on motorways, that one cannot stop to decipher.
  <br>  <br>
  ...lettering and spacing must be calculated according to the effect required. Though it is commonly done, it is not right to use the same type faces for poems as for the reports of Board meetings. For rapid reading the type must be simply and clear, the spaces between the letters and words exactly calculated, the space around each word sufficient to isolate it completely from its surroundings; while the letters and background must not be done in complementary colours.
  <br>  <br>
  ... Finally, a good designer could set a text with the reading time varying according to meaning and emphasis, just as a person changes speed in speech. To a certain extent, of course, this is already done with punctuation.
  <br>  <br>

<strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>
What font do you think would be used for rapid reading of a text?

<h3>RELATED TEXT 3: Unlearned Typography</h3>
<p>
<strong>Allan Haley (2004)</strong>
<br>  <br>
In this reading Haley states that typography does not necessarily have to be taught, and that common sense plays a huge role in creating a logical, functional and aesthetically pleasing piece of work.
<br>  <br>
"...Perhaps typography doesn’t have to be taught. Just maybe, all those courses that attempt to instil the canons of typographic design aren’t necessary.
<br>  <br>
...the craft of typography is a little more than the combination of three very simple things: attention to detail, common sense and visual acuity. Sure, there are typographic rules and guidelines, but they are, for the most part, just based on what is sensible and pleasing to the eye.
<br>  <br>
...the real key to typographic success is basically “sweating the details” and a simple coordination of mind and eye. Take, for instance, the typographic rule of avoiding all-cap headlines. It’s one of the first typographic rules of an educator’s hit lists.
<br>  <br>
...Correcting typographic widows and orphans is also just about making things look right, as is the rule about not cluttering the right edge of a column with a bunch of hyphens. Keeping word spacing tight and even is simply creating an inviting block of copy that does not have visually disrupting white-space gaps that also slow down the reading process.
<br>  <br>
...Okay, Typography probably should continue to be taught. An appreciation and understanding of the basis of good typography is a strong foundation to build on. But all the typographic education in the world is of little value if designers do not use a little common sense and look at the work they produce.
<br>  <br>
...It also takes the time and attention necessary to ensure that the job is done right — really right. This is what typography is all about. And that is what must also be part of any typographic curriculum.

<br>  <br>
<strong>QUESTION</strong>
<br>
Do you think Haley os correct in stating that good typography doesn't necesarilly have to be taught and that people with an eye for it will naturally create beautifully type-set work?

  <h2>Why they all relate</h2>
<p>
Each of these texts are related through the author providing the reader adivce and knowledge on how to become a better typographer. The ideas within the text cross over, as they all state the importance of understanding your text first before typesetting in order oto convey the message properly. Although each author does touch on the importance of different typographic elements, together they create a great guide on how to better your skills on typography. All these texts are reasonably old, besides "Unlearned Typography" and they therefor touch on how these typographic skills will make the printed result more legible for the reader. I have therefor chosen to make each text correspond and link to one another through using the CMYK colour pallette across the four readings; each reading will be dedicated to one of the colours.
</p>
<br>
  <h2>Examples of how I will present my reader</h2>
  <p>
  They will all be set up the same in terms of grid and margins, and be linked through this and the monochromatic colour scheme. The layout refernces and pulls inspiration from the readings and the theory behind each.
