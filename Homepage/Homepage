<h1>CREDO</h1>
<h2>Bob Noorda</h2>


<p>
I believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve,<br>
you should face it with rationality, logic and careful analysis if you want to get to the right idea. <br>
Graphic design is always a synthetic work: <br>
you need to reduce and remove until you reach the core of the message.<br>
When you work with typography and lettering, <br>
the essential goal is to obtain the best possible legibility. <br>
A good designer is the one who offers a good service through communication, <br>
not the one who wants to surprise at any cost, <br>
neither the one who wants to show how good he is. <br>
A designer is good if he can solve a problem,<br>
if he puts forward a useful solution.<br>
I believe that these rules could be a good start for a career in design.<br>
