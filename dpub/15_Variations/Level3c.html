<em>I believe that, whatever design problem you need to solve,
you should face it with rationality, logic and careful analysis if you want to get to the right idea.
Graphic design is always a synthetic work: </em>
you need to reduce and remove until you reach the core of the message.
When you work with typography and lettering,

A good designer is the one who offers a good service through communication,
not the one who wants to surprise at any cost,
neither the one who wants to show how good he is.
A designer is good if he can <em>solve a problem,</em>
if he puts forward a <em>useful solution.</em>
