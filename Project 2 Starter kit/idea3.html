				<p>The poem is based on dialoague and answering questions using playing cards. To draw on the idea of speech and dialogue, Idea 3 proposed making a mini podcast series on Souncloud. Each Recording will be labelled and each recording will only be a question or an answer, meaning there will be 18 posts all together. This is using soundcloud for something it is intended for, but at same time using that in an unusual way by purely posting small fragmets of the poem, forcing listeners to keep clicking onto the next post to finish the poem. I think using different voices for each post will also add theatrics.</p>
