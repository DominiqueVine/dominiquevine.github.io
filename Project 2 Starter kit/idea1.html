		<p>The found poem is essentially a conversation between a child and an adult. One set of cards would have the question, and one card game would have the answer.
		It would be fun and amsuing seeing what answer matched with what question. To represent this dialogue of going back and forth, I propose that Idea 1 is created on Instagram.
		The concept being that one instagram posts the question, and then the other instagram posts the answer. I think it would be interesting to use instagram as a way of speaking to someone as it is such a social and open network, and having a dialogue going across the platform in th form of posts is quite unusual.</p>
