				<p>The found poem is an question and answer game using cards and was made for children. Therefore to reflect the concept of asking questions and getting answers in return, Idea 2 proposes that the questions are asked on Snapchat, and then people are able to reply their own answers. After a while, the real answer will be posted and people will be able to view what the answer was. This will introduce a new level of interactivity to the poem uses snapchat as a platform to play games and ask questions to a specific group of people (who follow you).</p>
